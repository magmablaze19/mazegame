This was an assignment for my software development class. It is a first person maze navigation game built in java. 
The assignment was long form over the coruse of the entire semester, each project in the semester was to add a new feature to the program.
Additional features added include additional maze generation algorithms, two forms of automatic navigation, saving and loading mazes, and an android port of the software.
